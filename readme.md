# Adding HDMI/Composite inputs to Sony Watchman

Who doesn't love CRTs? I do... Electron guns are cool. It's gonna be a while before I get to this, 
but I found this Sony Watchman Radio/TV at the thrist store for $3.77. Out of one of my old TVs,
I scaveneged this board that breaks out the inputs from an HDMI and Composit connectors. I've looked around 
online, and am thinking I might be able to convert the signal on an FPGA. I'm not concerned about quality loss
as I have to convert it into RF to use the signal on the CRT.
